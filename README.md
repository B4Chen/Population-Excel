# Description:
Embark on an in-depth data population analysis project that delves into the population trends and dynamics of a specific region or demographic group. Through thorough data acquisition, organization, and preparation, we aim to unveil valuable insights into the population data, enabling a comprehensive understanding of its composition, characteristics, and changes over time.

# Analysis Derived from the Dataset:
The population in the United State is increasing however the yearly growth rate is slowly decreasing

# Conclusion
The data analysis reveals several significant trends regarding the population dynamics in the United States. Despite an overall increase in population, the growth rate has been gradually declining over the years. This suggests that while the population continues to grow, the rate of growth is slowing down.

Furthermore, the visual representation clearly indicates that the population is expected to keep increasing, albeit at a reduced pace in the coming years. This trend might indicate a shift in various demographic and societal factors within the United States, such as changes in birth rates, life expectancy, immigration patterns, and socio-economic conditions.

Moreover, the observation that the United States accounted for approximately 4% of the global population in the year 2020 underscores the country's significant demographic presence on the world stage. This finding highlights the critical role the United States plays in global population trends and its impact on various global socio-economic and political dynamics.
